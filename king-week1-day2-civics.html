            <strong>COACH'S SCRIPT:</strong><br><br>
            Alright striker, listen up! You know how your soccer team has different levels of leadership? You've got your team captain who makes calls on the field, your coach who manages the whole team, and the league director who oversees all the teams in the area. Well, government works the same way. You've got local government like your city mayor who handles things in your neighborhood, and state government like the governor who handles bigger stuff for the whole state of Arizona. Today you're learning who does what and why it matters to you. Because guess what? These are the people who decide if your soccer fields get fixed, if your streets are safe, and if your community has what it needs. This isn't boring stuff, this is real life. Let's break it down!

                Your city has a mayor who acts like the captain of your local team. The mayor is in charge of making decisions about things that affect your city, like parks, roads, schools, libraries, and emergency services. Just like a team captain needs to listen to the players and make good calls during a game, the mayor needs to listen to citizens and make decisions that help the whole city.

The governor works with the state legislature to create laws for the whole state.

                You might wonder why we need both local and state government. It's because some problems are best solved locally and others need a bigger approach. Your city knows what your neighborhood needs better than someone far away in the state capital, so local government handles local issues. But some things, like connecting all the cities with highways or protecting state parks, need the state government's bigger resources and coordination. It's like having both position coaches and a head coach on a football team—each has their job to do.

            <h3>🏋️ PHYSICAL MISSION: Government Services Scavenger Hunt</h3>
            <p>
                Your mission is to identify and document 10 government services you encounter or use in the next 24 hours. For each one, write down: (1) What the service is, (2) Whether it's provided by local or state government, and (3) How it helped you or your family. Examples: Did you drive on a state highway? Use a city park? Drink tap water? See police officers? Visit a library? Make a list and bring it back to share. This will help you see how much government affects your daily life!

                <strong>📖 BIBLE CONNECTION:</strong><br>
                Romans 13:1 - "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." God created government to serve and protect people. When local and state leaders do their jobs well, they're serving God by serving their communities. As citizens, we should respect these leaders, pray for them, and participate in making our communities better.
